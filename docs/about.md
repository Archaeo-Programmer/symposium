# About

WSU's <a href='https://cdsc.libraries.wsu.edu/'>Center for Digital Scholarship and Curation (CDSC)</a> and the University of Idaho's <a href='https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/'>Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)</a> are hosting the second annual Palouse Digital Scholarship Symposium this May 2019.

The week-long symposium will explore a broad variety of tools, techniques, and ideas informing the digital scholarship field. 
The 2019 symposium will be hosted alternately by both institutions, beginning on May 10 with introductions/setup and continuing the following week, May 13 to May 17, with workshops and discussions regarding digital scholarship technology and applications. 
Librarians and faculty connected with the CDIL and CDSC will direct the program and provide instruction.
View resources and outlines at the [Symposium repository](https://github.com/PalouseDH/symposium).

At the end of the symposium, groups composed of individuals from both campuses will present project ideas for a shared project between the two centers.
