# About

WSU's <a href='https://cdsc.libraries.wsu.edu/'>Center for Digtial Scholarship and Curation (CDSC)</a> and the University of Idaho's <a href='https://cdil.lib.uidaho.edu/'>Center for Digital Inquiry and Learning (CDIL)</a> are hosting the first ever Palouse Digital Scholarship Symposium this summer.

The week-long symposium will explore a broad variety of tools, techniques, and ideas informing the digital scholarship field. The symposium will hosted alternately by both institutions, beginning on May 11 with introductions/setup and continuing the following week, May 14 to May 18, with workshops and discussions regarding digital scholarship technology and applications. Librarians and faculty connected with the CDIL and CDSC will direct the program and provide instruction.

At the end of the symposium, groups composed of individuals from both campuses will present project ideas for a shared project between the two centers. CDIL and the CDSC will jointly pursue the winning project the following academic year.
