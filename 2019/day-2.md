## DH Discussion Session

Please look for a DH project that interests you, then:

- see if you can find background information about the project such as the data, people, tools, and outputs.
- share with the project with the group, using [Issue #12](https://github.com/PalouseDH/symposium/issues/12)
- we will discuss and deconstruct together

#### How Did They Make That? 

- DH projects deconstructions: explore source data, people, tools, outputs.
    - Miriam Posner, [How did they make that?](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/) 
    - DH Commons: [How did they make that? Programming Historian](http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1/editorial-sustainability-and-open-peer-review-programming-historian).
    - Sustainability? (how many dead projects have you seen?)
