## Parking

**University of Idaho:**
Participants will be able to park for free in any Red or Blue lot on the UI campus during the week.
However, on Friday, May 11, parking rules will be in force in all lots.
There are metered spots near the library and up the hill marked with a green line on this [google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1RqGoaIs33-ngb3Obh1tnViMISR8&ll=46.72613655314656%2C-117.01609835&z=18).

**Washington State University:**
There is a mix of parking on campus, paid and free.
Please see the [parking map](https://map.wsu.edu/t/53025DD3).
Parking near the library is expensive (about $16 for the day) so youâ€™ll probably want to park a bit further away and walk over to the CDSC.
