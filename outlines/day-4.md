## Objectives

- Critical understanding of text as data.
- Explore text visualization.

## Outline: 

## Morning

#### Discussion How Did They Make That? 

- Evan: Text and Data Analysis discussion, Ted Underwood.
    - structured data vs. unstructured data
    - OCR    
- DH projects deconstructions: explore source data, people, tools, outputs.
    - Miriam Posner, [How did they make that?](http://miriamposner.com/blog/how-did-they-make-that/). 
    - DH Commons: [How did they make that? Programming Historian](http://dhcommons.org/journal/issue-1/editorial-sustainability-and-open-peer-review-programming-historian).
    - Sustainability? (how many dead projects have you seen?)
- Parking Lot
    - any questions we should discuss?

#### Text visualization & analysis tool discussion and play time

- Quick discussion of tools that y'all are using or toola that can be used to visualize or analyze data.
    - [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)
    - [AntCon](http://www.laurenceanthony.net/)
    - A larger list at Western Michigan University [Libraries](http://libguides.wmich.edu/digitalhumanities/tools)
- Introductory hands-on with [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/)
    - We will be following, loosely, this  [outline](https://www.dwrl.utexas.edu/2016/11/29/voyant-for-text-analysis/) from UT Austin. It is a great introductory session targeted for use and completion within one class period. 
- Before we get started go grab some data!
    - [Natural Language Toolkit Corpora](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/)
    - If you would rather there are a few corpora included within Voyant Tools (just click through the links below to auto load the text):    
        - [Voyant Tools with Shakespeare corpora loaded](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=shakespeare)
        - [Voyant Tools with Jane Austen corpora loaded](http://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=austen)

## Afternoon

- Group work time
- Field trip: VR demos (time permitting)
