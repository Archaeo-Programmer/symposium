# Pitches

Digital scholarship is by nature collaborative and it is often project-based.
During the symposium project teams will work together to define a project pitch--a well-articulated idea for a digital scholarship project that engages with the tools, methods, theories and practices discussed during the week.
On the final day of the symposium project teams will have 15 minutes to pitch their project to the group and a set of interested audience members from UI and WSU.

Pairs.

Pitch template:

- **Focus: Challenge, Problem or Issue**
  - Digital scholarship addresses specific needs, challenges, issues or problems.
    - What set of challenges does your project meet?
    - What question is your project trying to answer?
    - What issue does your project engage with?
- **Proposed Solution or Template**
  - There is no one way to address a set of questions, but there is your way! How will you go about solving the problem or engaging with the question?
    - building a new tool
    - creating a different platform
    - producing a new set of workflows
    - linking together content in new ways
- **Environmental scan**
  - Chances are other people have had similar challenges or are tackling similar or related problems or issues. An environmental scan is a detailed look at:
    - Work-to-date that deals with your topic (i.e.—has a similar focus, set of inquiries or shares similar content)
    - Tools that engage with your problem/solution
    - Similar projects
  - Your pitch should engage with at least 3
- **Project Description**
  - This is your elevator speech, or your brief abstract that you will use to hook people in whether they be funders, stakeholders or potential collaborators.
- **Sustainability** (project scope and digital preservation)
  - All digital scholarship must engage with the question of sustainability.
    - Who or what institution will host your project? Is there a cost?
    - What tools or infrastructure is needed to maintain your project?
    - What might be the needs in five years for people to continue to use, engage with or build on your project?

# Physical Computing and Intro to Code

DH assumes computing. How can we learn about the computers and code that underpin our research and communication?
How can we examine our relationship with the digital world and the cultural assumptions embedded in it?

**Activity**

[Hello Arduino!](https://evanwill.github.io/hello-arduino/)

> materials provided by [The MILL](https://mill.lib.uidaho.edu/)

Objectives:

- What is a computer? Compare microcontroller ([Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)), minicomputer ([Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)), desktop computer, vs. server.
- What is code? Plain text, text editor, IDE.
- Free and open source software and hardware.
- Teaching & learning opportunities: Pair programming, Media Computation, and Peer Instruction. Active, collaborative learning with realistic, meaningful project based learning improves outcomes when teaching tech.

# Tech Setup Session

### Text editor!

All code is [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text).
The web is plain text.
`.html`, `.js`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.py`, `.r`, `.svg`, are all just text (with specialized writing in particular languages).
You need a good text editor!

Good options:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Evan's setup [notes](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/vs-code.html))
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Evan's setup [notes](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/atom-editor.html))
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (windows)

### GitHub orientation

- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Think carefully about the user name you choose. It will be on your profile, web URLs, and associated with your work.
- Install Git, see [Get-Git prep](https://evanwill.github.io/get-git/0-prep.html).
- Create a repository for your pitch?
- Markdown (time permitting), [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html).

**Resources**
