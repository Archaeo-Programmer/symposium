## Physical Computing and Intro to Code

DH assumes computing. How can we learn about the computers and code that underpin our research and communication?
How can we examine our relationship with the digital world and the cultural assumptions embedded in it?
Physical computing, minimal computing, critical making.

- What is a computer? Compare microcontroller ([Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)), minicomputer ([Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)), desktop computer, vs. server.
- What is code? Plain text, text editor, IDE.
- Free and open source software and hardware.
- Active, project based learning, "media computing"; digital literacy; computational thinking.

> "Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming." --[Arduino Guide](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Introduction)

## Tech Setup 

### Text editor!

All code is [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text).
The web is plain text.
You need a good text editor!

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (windows)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### GitHub Orientation

Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join).
Think carefully about the user name you choose. 
It will be on your profile, web URLs, and associated with your work.

Install Git, see [Get-Git prep](https://evanwill.github.io/get-git/0-prep.html).
