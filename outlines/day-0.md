Pairs

Pitch template:

- Focus/problem
- Environmental scan
- Project Description
- Sustainability (project scope and digital preservation)

# Physical Computing and Intro to Code

DH assumes computing. How can we learn about the computers and code that underpin our research and communication?
How can we examine our relationship with the digital world and the cultural assumptions embedded in it?

**Activity**

[Hello Arduino!](https://evanwill.github.io/hello-arduino/)

> materials provided by [The MILL](https://mill.lib.uidaho.edu/)

Objectives:

- What is a computer? Compare microcontroller ([Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/)), minicomputer ([Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/)), desktop computer, vs. server.
- What is code? Plain text, text editor, IDE.
- Free and open source software and hardware.
- Learning opportunities: active, project based learning, "media computing"; digital literacy; computational thinking.

# Tech Setup Session

### Text editor!

All code is [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text).
The web is plain text.
`.html`, `.js`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.py`, `.r`, `.svg`, are all just text (with specialized writing in particular languages).
You need a good text editor!

Good options:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Evan's setup [notes](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/vs-code.html))
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (Evan's setup [notes](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/atom-editor.html))
- [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (windows)

### GitHub orientation

- Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/join). Think carefully about the user name you choose. It will be on your profile, web URLs, and associated with your work.
- Install Git, see [Get-Git prep](https://evanwill.github.io/get-git/0-prep.html).
- Create a repository for your pitch?
- Markdown (time permitting), [Markdown in a Minute](https://evanwill.github.io/_drafts/notes/markdown-minute.html).

**Resources**
