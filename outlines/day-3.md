### Embedding on the web: hands-on with [Knightlab tools](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/projects/)

- [Data from our collections](https://dcnb.github.io/pulsesoup/data/)

 TimelineJS Steps

 1. Download data by pushing the download button on the top right of the page, then clicking the "Timelinejs csv" button
 2. Upload the csv into Google Drive
 3. Find the csv file in your drive (can hit the magnifying glass after upload), right click on it, open the csv with Google Sheets
 4. Make some edits to the content
    - At the very least delete the two rows that have no date in them.

 5. Follow [instructions via knightlab](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make)
    - Click the File menu button at the top of the page, then click "Publish to the Web"
    - On the following pop-up, click "Publish", then click OK on the next "sure you want to do this" dialog, then close the dialog
    - Copy the url for your google sheet from your browser (do not copy the url provided by the dialog)
    - paste it into the [knightlab site](https://timeline.knightlab.com/#make)
    - SEE WHAT YOU HAVE WROUGHT!
 6. Go to the knightlab site's step 4 and copy the embed link
 7. Go to your digital collection website on github (mine is pulsesoup)
 8. Paste that code right below the second "---" in the "_layouts/timeline.html" file.
 9. Check out your site to see how if it's working.
